// Exercise 1
 
// â€‹Create an array to represent your shopping list with the following items: 'pop tarts', 'ramen noodles', 'chips', 'salsa', and 'coffee'.
// Add 'fruit loops' to the list.
// Update 'coffee' to 'fair trade coffee'
// Replace 'chips' and 'salsa' with 'rice' and 'beans'
// Create an empty array to represent your shopping cart.
// Remove the last item from your shopping list and add it to your cart

// Remove the first item from your shopping list and add it to the cart

// Write a 'while' loop that takes items from your shopping list and moves them to your cart until there are no items left on the list.

// Sort the items in your cart alphabetically... backwards

// Print the list of items in your shopping cart to the console as comma separated string.
